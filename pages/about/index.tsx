            I am a software engineer at Traveloka, specializing in software
            engineering with over three years of hands-on experience. I am also
            a mentor for people who want to learn about software engineering.

              One of my most significant achievements was earning a promotion to
              the role of senior software engineer within the first year of my
              professional career.

              During this time, I created the program responsible for generating
              comprehensive reports. These reports served as the company&apos;s
              official documentation submitted to the Minister of Environment
              and Forestry, showcasing our commitment and responsibility.
